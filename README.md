>> My First Java Case

This is a case ellaborated with many resources, to participate in a internship process. 

It was my first case, my first code, my first project, including all the programming languages. 

I did enjoy doing all the steps of it and I don't know why I didn't practice before. 
I learnt a lot while programming and doing a lot or research.

I can't wait to start practicing more!
